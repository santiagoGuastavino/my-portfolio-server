This REST API was built with [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/).   
It's purpose: sending myself contact emails anytime somebody fills the contact form from my [Portfolio Website](https://santiagoguastavino.com/).  
I achieved this with a Gmail account and [nodemailer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer).
