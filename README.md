_This REST API was built with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)._  
_It's purpose: sending myself e-mails from my [Portfolio Web Application](https://my-portfolio-eta-lemon.vercel.app/)._  
_I achieved this with [Twilio's SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) platform and a [nodemailer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer) instance._
